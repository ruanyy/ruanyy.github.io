		<div id="description">It is my second year at Cal. I tried a lot of different things, but nothing about programming. Several of my CS friends applied for the WDD decal but unexpectedly I am the only one who got in. Now I started spending at one hour every night on learning or trying coding. Since I recently moved to a new apartment, I started cooking myself, and it's really enjoyable. This year could be a year of miracles if I do devote myself into the plans I have made -- continuing creating the website my friend created for me as a birthday gift and studying abroad in Germany in 2015. Continue embracing every drop of moments. Schoenen Tag and wonderful life. :)</div>
